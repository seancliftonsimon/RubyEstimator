# Enhanced Logging Implementation - Summary

## What Was Done

Comprehensive diagnostic logging has been added throughout the vehicle resolution system to help diagnose any issues that arise.

## Files Modified

### 1. `vehicle_data.py`

**Added:**

- INFO logging for all vehicle processing requests
- DEBUG logging for resolution details (run_id, latency, field status)
- WARNING logging for missing fields
- ERROR logging with full stack traces for failures
- Citation count tracking

**Key Log Messages:**

```
üîç Processing vehicle request: 2016 Toyota Camry
‚úì Vehicle resolution completed successfully
‚ö†Ô∏è Missing fields for 2016 Toyota Camry: ['curb_weight']
‚ùå Vehicle resolution failed: [error details with stack trace]
```

### 2. `single_call_gemini_resolver.py`

**Added:**

- Detailed JSON parsing logs (shows raw response, cleaned response, parsing steps)
- Field status logging (which fields present, their statuses and values)
- Validation and normalization tracking
- Data type conversion warnings
- Out-of-range value warnings
- Database operation logs (inserts, updates, commits)
- Enhanced retry logging

**Key Log Messages:**

````
üì¶ Parsing JSON response...
Stripped ```json markdown wrapper
‚úì JSON parsed in 0.50ms
curb_weight: status=found, value=3310
‚ö†Ô∏è Weight 500 lbs outside valid range (1500-10000), rejecting
‚ö†Ô∏è Unrecognized boolean string value: 'maybe'
Persisting to database: vehicle_key=2016_toyota_camry
‚úì Database transaction committed successfully
````

## Test Results

All tests passed with enhanced logging:

```
[OK] API failure test passed
[OK] Data not found test passed (with partial data)
[OK] Success case test passed
[OK] Retry logic test passed (succeeded on 3rd attempt)

[SUCCESS] All tests passed!
```

### Sample Log Output from Tests

**API Failure Test:**

```
2025-10-29 09:24:44 - vehicle_data - ERROR - ‚ùå Vehicle resolution failed for 2016 Toyota Camry: 503 UNAVAILABLE. The model is overloaded.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  [Full stack trace shown]
RuntimeError: 503 UNAVAILABLE. The model is overloaded.
```

**Missing Field Warning:**

```
2025-10-29 09:24:44 - vehicle_data - WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing fields for 2016 Toyota Camry: ['curb_weight']
```

**Retry Logic:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Retryable error on attempt 1: 503 UNAVAILABLE. The model is overloaded.
üîÑ Retry attempt 2/3 after 2s delay...
‚ö†Ô∏è Retryable error on attempt 2: 503 UNAVAILABLE. The model is overloaded.
üîÑ Retry attempt 3/3 after 4s delay...
‚úì API call completed in 6005.31ms
```

## Logging Levels

The system uses standard Python logging levels:

| Level       | Current Output                                                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **INFO**    | ‚úì High-level operations (vehicle requests, API calls, completions)          |
| **DEBUG**   | Field details, validation steps, DB operations (enable for troubleshooting) |
| **WARNING** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing data, validation failures, retries                               |
| **ERROR**   | ‚ùå Failures with full stack traces                                          |

## How to Use

### Normal Operation (Default)

No changes needed. INFO level is set by default and provides good visibility into the process.

### Detailed Diagnostics

Set environment variable before running:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
streamlit run app.py
```

### Capture Logs to File

```powershell
streamlit run app.py > logs.txt 2>&1
```

Then analyze:

```powershell
# Find all errors
Select-String -Path logs.txt -Pattern "ERROR"

# Find warnings
Select-String -Path logs.txt -Pattern "WARNING"

# Track a specific vehicle
Select-String -Path logs.txt -Pattern "2016 Toyota Camry"

# Track a specific run by run_id
Select-String -Path logs.txt -Pattern "abc123"
```

## What You Can Diagnose

### 1. API Issues

- **503 Errors**: See retry attempts with delays
- **Timeouts**: See exact timing of API calls
- **Rate Limits**: Identified as retryable errors

### 2. Data Parsing Issues

- **JSON Errors**: See exact position of parsing failure
- **Missing Fields**: Which fields were omitted from API response
- **Markdown Stripping**: Whether code blocks were present and removed

### 3. Validation Issues

- **Out of Range**: Values rejected for being outside valid ranges
- **Type Mismatches**: Wrong data types in API responses
- **Null Values**: When and why values are set to null

### 4. Database Issues

- **Insert Failures**: Which record failed to save
- **Commit Issues**: Transaction problems
- **Upsert Operations**: Which records were updated vs created

### 5. Performance Issues

- **Slow API Calls**: See exact timing breakdown
- **Database Bottlenecks**: DB write times shown
- **Overall Latency**: Complete timing breakdown

## Example Diagnostic Session

**Problem**: Vehicle search returns "Weight Not Found"

**Step 1: Check the logs**

```powershell
Select-String -Path logs.txt -Pattern "2016 Toyota Camry"
```

**Step 2: Find the run_id**

```
Run ID: abc123def456
```

**Step 3: Get all logs for that run**

```powershell
Select-String -Path logs.txt -Pattern "abc123def456"
```

**Step 4: Look for the issue**

Possible findings:

- `ERROR - ‚ùå API call failed`: API issue, not data issue
- `WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing fields: ['curb_weight']`: API succeeded but no data
- `WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è Weight 15000 lbs outside valid range`: Data found but invalid
- `curb_weight: status=not_found, value=None`: API returned "not found" status

**Step 5: Take Action**

- If API error: Wait and retry
- If data not found: Try different year
- If validation error: Check if weight is realistic
- If parse error: Report the issue with full logs

## Benefits

1. **Complete Visibility**: Every step of the process is logged
2. **Easy Diagnosis**: Clear messages indicate what went wrong where
3. **Performance Tracking**: Timing information for every operation
4. **Error Context**: Full stack traces with detailed error messages
5. **Traceability**: run_id links all operations for a single request
6. **Validation Tracking**: See why data was accepted or rejected
7. **Database Audit**: Complete record of what was written to DB

## Documentation

Full guides available:

- `LOGGING_GUIDE.md` - Complete logging reference with examples
- `ERROR_HANDLING_QUICK_GUIDE.md` - User-friendly error message guide
- `CURB_WEIGHT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Technical details of the error handling fix

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Production Logs**: Watch for patterns of failures
2. **Adjust Log Levels**: Use DEBUG for development, INFO for production
3. **Set Up Log Rotation**: Prevent log files from growing too large
4. **Create Alerts**: Monitor for ERROR level messages
5. **Analyze Performance**: Track API call times over time

## Testing

Run the test suite to see logging in action:

```powershell
python test_error_handling.py
```

Expected output includes INFO, WARNING, and ERROR messages demonstrating all logging functionality.

## Support

When reporting issues, include:

1. Full log excerpt with ERROR/WARNING messages
2. The run_id from the logs
3. Vehicle information (year, make, model)
4. What you expected vs what happened

This comprehensive logging will make diagnosing any issues straightforward!
