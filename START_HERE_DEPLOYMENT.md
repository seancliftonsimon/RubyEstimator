## 💡 Key Decisions You'll Make

### 1. Which Hosting Platform?

**Recommendation:** Streamlit Cloud + Neon PostgreSQL

**Why?**

- ✅ 100% FREE
- ✅ Easiest for Streamlit apps
- ✅ Auto-deploys from GitHub
- ✅ Takes 30 minutes

**Trade-off:** App sleeps after 15 min (10-30 sec wake-up)

**Alternative:** Railway ($8/month) - All-in-one, always-on

👉 **See full comparison:** `HOSTING_OPTIONS_COMPARISON.md`

### 2. SQLite or PostgreSQL?

**You need PostgreSQL** for cloud deployment.

**Why?**

- SQLite is file-based (doesn't work in cloud)
- PostgreSQL is cloud-native
- Your app already supports both!

**Migration:** We have a script for this (`migrate_to_postgres.py`)

### 3. Public or Private App?

**Default:** Public (free)

- Anyone with the URL can access it
- Good for: Internal tools, MVPs, demos

**Private:** Requires paid plan

- Streamlit for Teams: $250/month
- Railway/Render: Private by default

**Security:** You can add password protection (already in your code!)

## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

Before you start deployment, make sure you have:

- [ ] **GitHub account** - Free sign-up at https://github.com
- [ ] **Code on GitHub** - Your repo pushed
- [ ] **Google Gemini API key** - From https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- [ ] **Local app working** - Test with `streamlit run app.py`
- [ ] **SQLite database** - `rubyestimator_local.db` with your data

**If you have all of these,** you're ready to deploy! 🎉

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't:** Commit `.env` or `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to git  
✅ **Do:** Verify they're in `.gitignore` (they already are)

❌ **Don't:** Use SQLite in production  
✅ **Do:** Migrate to PostgreSQL (use our migration script)

❌ **Don't:** Hardcode API keys in your code  
✅ **Do:** Use Streamlit secrets (your code already does this)

❌ **Don't:** Skip testing locally with cloud database  
✅ **Do:** Test with cloud DB before deploying

❌ **Don't:** Deploy without reading the quick start  
✅ **Do:** Follow `DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md` step-by-step
