# Error Handling Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed

The generic "Weight Not Found" error has been replaced with specific, actionable error messages.

## New Error Messages

### 1. Search Error (API Failure)

**When you'll see it:** Gemini API is overloaded, down, or unreachable

```
‚ùå Search Error: Unable to search for vehicle data due to a temporary issue.
Error details: 503 UNAVAILABLE. The model is overloaded.

üí° What to do next:
- Try again in a few moments (API might be overloaded)
- Use the Manual Entry option below if you know the vehicle's curb weight
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**

- System automatically retries 3 times with delays (2s ‚Üí 4s ‚Üí 8s)
- Only if all retries fail, you'll see this error

### 2. Curb Weight Not Found (Data Missing)

**When you'll see it:** Search succeeded but couldn't find curb weight

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Curb Weight Not Found: The search completed but could not find reliable curb weight data for this vehicle.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Found partial data:
‚úì Aluminum Engine: true
‚úì Aluminum Rims: true
‚úì Cat Converters: 2

üí° What to do next:
- Try a different model year (curb weight data may be available for nearby years)
- Use the Manual Entry option below if you know the vehicle's curb weight
```

**Note:** You'll see any data that WAS found (engine type, rims, converters)

### 3. Vehicle Not Found

**When you'll see it:** Vehicle doesn't exist or year is wrong

```
‚ùå Vehicle Not Found: 2025 Toyota Nonexistent does not appear to be a real vehicle or was not manufactured in this year. Please check your input.
```

### 4. Success

**When you'll see it:** Everything worked!

```
‚úÖ Vehicle Found! 2016 Toyota Camry
```

## Automatic Retry Behavior

When the Gemini API returns temporary errors (503, rate limits, unavailable):

| Attempt | Delay Before | Total Wait |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 1       | 0s           | 0s         |
| 2       | 2s           | 2s         |
| 3       | 4s           | 6s         |

**Total max wait:** ~6 seconds before giving up

**Retryable errors:**

- 503 Service Unavailable
- Rate limit exceeded
- Model overloaded
- API unavailable

**Non-retryable errors** (fail immediately):

- Invalid API key
- Malformed request
- Network errors

## User Actions

### If you see "Search Error"

1. **Wait 30-60 seconds** - API might be temporarily overloaded
2. **Try again** - Click search button again
3. **Use Manual Entry** - If you know the curb weight, enter it directly
4. **Check status** - Visit https://status.google.com/ for API status

### If you see "Curb Weight Not Found"

1. **Try nearby years** - E.g., if 2016 fails, try 2015 or 2017
2. **Check spelling** - Verify make/model names
3. **Use Manual Entry** - Look up curb weight on manufacturer website
4. **Check partial data** - Use any fields that WERE found

## Testing the Fixes

Run the test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_error_handling.py
```

Expected output:

```
‚úì API failure test passed
‚úì Data not found test passed (with partial data)
‚úì Success case test passed
‚úì Retry logic test passed (succeeded on 3rd attempt)

‚úÖ All tests passed!
```

## Configuration

Want to adjust retry behavior? Edit `single_call_gemini_resolver.py`:

```python
# Line ~261
max_retries = 3       # Change number of attempts
retry_delay = 2       # Change initial delay (seconds)
```
