# Implementation Summary: Vehicle Data System Improvements

## Executive Summary

Your vehicle data system has been comprehensively improved with all 5 concrete updates you requested. The system now stores ranges with metadata, uses evidence-based source scoring, applies clear decision rules, enforces confidence thresholds before writes, and produces consolidated resolution reports.

## ✅ All 5 Improvements Implemented

### 1. ✅ Store Conditions and Ranges, Not Just Single Values

**Implementation**: `ValueRange` class in `improved_data_models.py`

```python
@dataclass
class ValueRange:
    low: Optional[float]           # Lower bound
    high: Optional[float]          # Upper bound
    chosen: Optional[float]        # Selected value
    estimate_type: str             # "median_of_trusted", "consensus", etc.
    variant_needed_for_exact: bool # True if trim/engine matters
```

**Example**:

```python
# Before: Just 3500
# After:
ValueRange(
    low=3450,
    high=3550,
    chosen=3500,
    estimate_type="median_of_trusted",
    variant_needed_for_exact=False
)
```

**Benefit**: Preserves uncertainty while presenting one number to users. You know the data quality and can flag when exact value needs trim info.

---

### 2. ✅ Evidence Scoring That Matches Reality

**Implementation**: `SourceTrust` enum and `EvidenceScore` class

```python
class SourceTrust(Enum):
    HIGH = 1.0      # OEM specs, owner's manual, official parts catalogs
    MEDIUM = 0.7    # KBB, Edmunds, Cars.com, reputable reviews
    LOW = 0.4       # Dealer listings, parts retailers, forums
    UNKNOWN = 0.2   # Unverified sources
```

**Automatic classification**:

```python
# Automatically detects and classifies sources
trust = SourceTrust.classify_source("Toyota.com official specs")
# Returns: SourceTrust.HIGH (1.0)

trust = SourceTrust.classify_source("KBB.com")
# Returns: SourceTrust.MEDIUM (0.7)

trust = SourceTrust.classify_source("Car forum post")
# Returns: SourceTrust.LOW (0.4)
```

**Evidence scoring**:

```python
@dataclass
class EvidenceScore:
    weighted_score: float   # Sum of (trust × confidence) across sources
    source_count: int
    highest_trust: SourceTrust
    sources: List[Dict]     # Detailed source info with trust levels
```

**Benefit**: OEM PDFs no longer mislabeled as "low quality". Clear minimum weighted score required before writing.

---

### 3. ✅ Clear Decision Rules Per Attribute

**Implementation**: `DecisionRules` class with method per field type

#### Curb Weight

```python
@staticmethod
def resolve_curb_weight(candidates) -> FieldResolution:
    """
    Rule: Take median of HIGH and MEDIUM trust sources
    Store {low, high, chosen}
    Flag variant_needed if range > 10% of median
    """
```

#### Aluminum Engine

```python
@staticmethod
def resolve_aluminum_engine(candidates) -> FieldResolution:
    """
    Rule: Boolean with high bar (OEM docs only for 0.95 confidence)
    Weight votes by source trust
    Once true with high confidence, it's variant-stable
    """
```

#### Aluminum Rims

```python
@staticmethod
def resolve_aluminum_rims(candidates) -> FieldResolution:
    """
    Rule: Trim-dependent with market default
    Store trim-specific values as conditional facts
    Default to most common, flag variant_needed if multiple trims
    """
```

#### Catalytic Converters

```python
@staticmethod
def resolve_catalytic_converters(candidates) -> FieldResolution:
    """
    Rule: Engine-dependent with range
    Store engine-specific counts as conditional facts
    If engine unknown, store range without choosing (don't guess)
    Lower threshold (0.6) due to data scarcity
    """
```

**Benefit**: Predictable, consistent outcomes. Same inputs always produce same results. No ad-hoc judgments.

---

### 4. ✅ Confidence Thresholds That Control Writes

**Implementation**: Write gates in `DecisionRules` and `should_write_to_database()`

```python
class DecisionRules:
    # Thresholds that control DB writes
    MIN_CONFIDENCE_FOR_WRITE = 0.7
    MIN_EVIDENCE_WEIGHT_FOR_WRITE = 0.7
    MIN_SOURCES_FOR_WRITE = 1
```

**Write logic**:

```python
def should_write_to_database(resolution: FieldResolution) -> bool:
    """Only write if ALL conditions met:"""
    if resolution.status != "ok":
        return False  # Must have 'ok' status

    if resolution.confidence < 0.7:
        return False  # Must meet confidence threshold

    if not resolution.evidence.meets_threshold(0.7, 1):
        return False  # Must meet evidence weight threshold

    return True
```

**For borderline fields (70% confidence)**:

- If evidence_weight < 0.7: Store as `status="needs_review"`, don't write to DB
- If evidence_weight ≥ 0.7: Write to DB with range + warnings

**Benefit**: Database won't silently fill with known-iffy values. Clear blocking reasons logged.

---

### 5. ✅ One Consolidated Resolution Report

**Implementation**: `ResolutionReport` class with compact formatting

**Before**: Scattered warnings across 100+ lines

```
Processing: 2022 Toyota Camry
  -> Found 3 candidates for curb weight
  -> Resolved curb weight: 3310 lbs
  -> Confidence score: 0.85
  -> Method: median
  -> Warning: Some variation in sources
  -> Warning: Check for trim differences
  -> Found 2 candidates for aluminum engine
  ...
  [continues for many lines]
```

**After**: One compact report (~20 lines)

```
=== Resolution Report: 2022 Toyota Camry ===
Strategy: single_call | Outcome: complete | Confidence: 0.85

• curb_weight:
  Value: 3310 | Confidence: 0.85 | Status: ok
  Range: [3280 - 3340] (median_of_trusted)
  Evidence: 3 sources (trust: HIGH, score: 2.55)
    - Toyota.com official specs
    - KBB.com
    - Edmunds.com

• aluminum_engine:
  Value: True | Confidence: 0.90 | Status: ok
  Evidence: 2 sources (trust: HIGH, score: 1.8)
    - Toyota.com official specs
    - MotorTrend technical review

• aluminum_rims:
  Value: True | Confidence: 0.80 | Status: ok
  ⚠ Trim-dependent: 3 variants found - default set to most common
  Evidence: 4 sources (trust: MEDIUM, score: 2.24)

• catalytic_converters:
  Value: 2 | Confidence: 0.70 | Status: ok
  Range: [2 - 2] (engine_dependent)
  Evidence: 2 sources (trust: MEDIUM, score: 1.4)

Action needed: NO
```

**Benefit**: Faster human scan, all critical info in one place, clear action items.

## How to Use the Improved System

### Quick Start

```python
from improved_vehicle_processor import ImprovedVehicleProcessor
from improved_resolution_integration import initialize_enhanced_database
import os

# 1. Initialize enhanced database (one time)
initialize_enhanced_database()

# 2. Create processor
processor = ImprovedVehicleProcessor(
    api_key=os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY"),
    confidence_threshold=0.7,
    use_cache=True
)

# 3. Process vehicle
report = processor.process_vehicle(2022, "Toyota", "Camry", progress_callback)

# 4. Get compact report
print(report.format_compact_report())

# 5. Get values approved for database write (only high-confidence, high-evidence)
db_values = processor.get_values_for_database(report)

# 6. Write to legacy database if needed
if db_values.get('curb_weight_lbs'):
    update_vehicle_data_in_db(
        2022, "Toyota", "Camry",
        db_values['curb_weight_lbs'],
        db_values.get('aluminum_engine'),
        db_values.get('aluminum_rims'),
        db_values.get('catalytic_converters')
    )
```

### Run Demonstration

```bash
python improved_vehicle_processor.py
```

This will:

1. Initialize the enhanced database
2. Process test vehicles
3. Show consolidated reports
4. Display statistics
5. Demonstrate all 5 improvements in action

---

## Integration with Existing Code

### Option 1: Gradual Migration (Recommended)

Keep `vehicle_data.py` as-is, add improved system alongside:

```python
# In vehicle_data.py, add:
from improved_vehicle_processor import ImprovedVehicleProcessor
from improved_resolution_integration import (
    initialize_enhanced_database,
    get_cached_resolution_report
)

# Initialize once at startup
initialize_enhanced_database()

# In process_vehicle(), add at the beginning:
def process_vehicle(year, make, model, progress_callback=None):
    # Try improved system first
    processor = ImprovedVehicleProcessor(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)
    report = processor.process_vehicle(year, make, model, progress_callback)

    if report and report.outcome == "complete":
        # Use improved result
        db_values = processor.get_values_for_database(report)
        update_vehicle_data_in_db(year, make, model, **db_values)
        return db_values

    # Fallback to existing logic
    # ... (keep existing code)
```

### Option 2: Full Replacement

Replace `process_vehicle()` entirely with improved version. See `improved_vehicle_processor.py` for complete implementation.

## Key Improvements Demonstrated

### Example 1: Range Storage

```python
# Curb weight resolution
resolution.value_range = ValueRange(
    low=3280,
    high=3340,
    chosen=3310,
    estimate_type="median_of_trusted",
    variant_needed_for_exact=False  # Only 1.8% variation
)
```

### Example 2: Evidence Scoring

```python
# Evidence from multiple sources
resolution.evidence = EvidenceScore(
    weighted_score=2.55,  # (1.0 × 0.85) + (0.7 × 0.85) + (0.7 × 0.85)
    source_count=3,
    highest_trust=SourceTrust.HIGH,
    sources=[
        {'name': 'Toyota.com', 'trust': 'HIGH', 'confidence': 0.85},
        {'name': 'KBB.com', 'trust': 'MEDIUM', 'confidence': 0.85},
        {'name': 'Edmunds.com', 'trust': 'MEDIUM', 'confidence': 0.85}
    ]
)
```

### Example 3: Conditional Facts (Trim-Dependent)

```python
# Aluminum rims varies by trim
resolution.conditional_values = [
    ConditionalFact(
        condition="trim=base",
        value=False,  # Steel rims
        confidence=0.85,
        sources=['Toyota.com trim comparison']
    ),
    ConditionalFact(
        condition="trim=SE",
        value=True,   # Aluminum rims
        confidence=0.90,
        sources=['Toyota.com', 'KBB.com']
    )
]
resolution.value_range.variant_needed_for_exact = True
```

### Example 4: Write Control

```python
# Only write if thresholds met
if resolution.confidence >= 0.7 and resolution.evidence.weighted_score >= 0.7:
    resolution.status = "ok"
    # Will be written to database
else:
    resolution.status = "needs_review"
    # Will NOT be written to database
    resolution.warnings.append("Insufficient confidence or evidence")
```
