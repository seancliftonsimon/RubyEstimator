# Implementation Plan

- [X] 1. Create SingleCallVehicleResolver class and data structures





  - Implement SingleCallVehicleResolver class with comprehensive prompt generation
  - Create VehicleSpecificationBundle dataclass for structured response handling
  - Implement structured JSON response parsing with validation
  - Add error handling for malformed responses and partial data
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.4_

- [X] 2. Implement comprehensive single-call prompt system





  - Create field-specific prompt that requests all specifications simultaneously
  - Design structured JSON response format with confidence scores and source citations
  - Implement source prioritization (manufacturer websites, KBB, Edmunds) in prompt
  - Add validation for reasonable value ranges and data consistency checks
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 3. Integrate SingleCallVehicleResolver with existing vehicle_data.py




  - Replace multi-call resolver approach in process_vehicle function
  - Maintain compatibility with existing database storage and caching mechanisms
  - Preserve ProvenanceTracker integration for resolution history
  - Implement fallback to existing multi-call system when single-call fails
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 4. Update vehicle resolution functions to use single-call approach
  - Modify get_curb_weight_from_api to use SingleCallVehicleResolver as primary method
  - Update get_aluminum_engine_from_api to extract from single-call response
  - Update get_aluminum_rims_from_api to extract from single-call response
  - Update get_catalytic_converter_count_from_api to extract from single-call response
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement fallback and error handling mechanisms
  - Add graceful degradation to existing multi-call resolver when single-call fails
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for API failures
  - Handle partial responses where some specifications are missing
  - Add intelligent defaults based on vehicle characteristics for missing data
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.2, 3.5_

- [ ]* 6. Add comprehensive testing for single-call resolver
  - Write unit tests for SingleCallVehicleResolver class and response parsing
  - Create integration tests comparing single-call vs multi-call accuracy
  - Test fallback mechanisms and error recovery scenarios
  - Add performance tests measuring API call reduction and response time improvement
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.5_

- [ ]* 7. Add monitoring and performance tracking
  - Implement metrics collection for single-call vs multi-call performance comparison
  - Add confidence score tracking and accuracy monitoring
  - Create dashboard for monitoring API call reduction and system performance
  - Add logging for resolution method selection and fallback usage
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.5_
