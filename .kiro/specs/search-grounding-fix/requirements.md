# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Ruby GEM Estimator application is failing with "400 Search Grounding is not supported" errors when making API calls to Google AI. The issue is that the current implementation uses an incorrect tool configuration for search grounding. Based on the Google Gemini cookbook (Search_Grounding.ipynb), the tool configuration needs to be updated from `{"google_search_retrieval": {}}` to `{"google_search": {}}` to properly enable search grounding functionality. The cookbook serves as the authoritative reference for proper search grounding implementation.

## Glossary

- **Search Grounding**: Google AI feature that allows the model to search the web for current information to provide more accurate responses
- **Tool Configuration**: The parameter structure passed to the Google AI API to enable specific tools like search
- **Google AI API**: The Google Generative AI API used for making AI-powered queries
- **Ruby GEM Estimator**: The vehicle data resolution application that uses AI to find vehicle specifications
- **Google Gemini Cookbook**: The authoritative reference documentation (Search_Grounding.ipynb) that provides correct implementation patterns for search grounding

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the search grounding API calls to use the correct tool configuration, so that vehicle data resolution can access current web information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system makes a Google AI API call with search grounding, THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL use the tool configuration `{"google_search": {}}` instead of `{"google_search_retrieval": {}}`
2. WHEN the system processes vehicle validation requests, THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL successfully complete API calls without "Search Grounding is not supported" errors
3. WHEN the system processes curb weight resolution requests, THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL successfully complete API calls without "Search Grounding is not supported" errors
4. WHEN the system processes aluminum engine resolution requests, THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL successfully complete API calls without "Search Grounding is not supported" errors
5. WHEN the system processes aluminum rims resolution requests, THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL successfully complete API calls without "Search Grounding is not supported" errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all search grounding configurations to be consistent with the Google Gemini cookbook, so that maintenance and debugging are simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL use search grounding tool configuration that matches the Google Gemini cookbook examples
2. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL update all instances of `google_search_retrieval` to `google_search` in the resolver module
3. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL update all instances of `google_search_retrieval` to `google_search` in the vehicle_data module
4. WHEN a developer searches the codebase for search grounding configurations, THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL show only the correct `google_search` configuration as specified in the cookbook
5. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL maintain all existing functionality while using the cookbook-compliant tool configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the vehicle estimation system, I want the application to successfully resolve vehicle data, so that I can get accurate vehicle specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request vehicle data resolution, THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL complete the process without API configuration errors
2. WHEN the system validates vehicle existence, THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL return valid results using web search
3. WHEN the system resolves vehicle specifications, THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL access current web information through search grounding
4. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL maintain the same response format and data quality after the configuration fix
5. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL log successful API calls instead of error messages for search grounding operations
