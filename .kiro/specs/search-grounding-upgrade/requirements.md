# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Ruby GEM Estimator application currently uses the legacy `google.generativeai` SDK with an outdated search grounding implementation that causes "Unknown field for FunctionDeclaration: google_search" errors. Based on the official Google Gemini cookbook (Search_Grounding.ipynb), the application needs to be upgraded to use the modern `google-genai` SDK (v1.0.0+) with the correct API patterns for search grounding functionality. This upgrade will enable reliable web search capabilities for vehicle data resolution and eliminate current API errors.

## Glossary

- **google-genai SDK**: The modern Python SDK for Google Gemini API (v1.0.0+) that supports current search grounding features
- **google.generativeai SDK**: The legacy Python SDK that has compatibility issues with current search grounding
- **Search Grounding**: Google AI feature that allows models to search the web for current information
- **Client-based API**: The modern API pattern using `genai.Client()` instead of direct model instantiation
- **Config-based Tools**: The modern way to specify tools using `config={"tools": [...]}` instead of `tools=[...]`
- **Ruby GEM Estimator**: The vehicle data resolution application requiring web search capabilities
- **Gemini 2.0+ Models**: The latest Gemini models that support enhanced search grounding features

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to use the modern Google AI SDK, so that search grounding functionality works reliably without API errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL use the `google-genai` SDK version 1.0.0 or higher instead of the legacy `google.generativeai` SDK
2. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL use the client-based API pattern with `genai.Client()` for all API interactions
3. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL use Gemini 2.0+ models (gemini-2.0-flash-exp, gemini-2.5-flash) that support enhanced search grounding
4. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL eliminate all "Unknown field for FunctionDeclaration" errors through proper SDK usage
5. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing vehicle data resolution functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the search grounding configuration to follow the official cookbook patterns, so that the implementation is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL use the config-based tool specification pattern: `config={"tools": [{"google_search": {}}]}`
2. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL replace all direct `tools=[{"google_search": {}}]` parameters with the config-based approach
3. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL use the `client.models.generate_content()` method instead of direct model instantiation
4. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL implement proper error handling for the new SDK patterns
5. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL follow the cookbook's recommended authentication and configuration patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the vehicle estimation system, I want enhanced search grounding capabilities, so that I can get more accurate and current vehicle data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL access grounding metadata including search queries and source URLs for transparency
2. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL provide enhanced search result quality through improved model capabilities
3. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL support real-time information access for current vehicle specifications
4. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL maintain response times comparable to or better than the current implementation
5. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL log search grounding metadata for debugging and quality assurance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want the upgraded implementation to be future-proof, so that it remains compatible with Google AI API evolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL use the latest stable API patterns recommended by Google
2. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL implement proper dependency management for the new SDK
3. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL include migration documentation for the SDK upgrade
4. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL maintain configuration flexibility for different Gemini model versions
5. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL implement comprehensive testing for the new SDK integration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want enhanced debugging capabilities, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot search grounding operations effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL log search queries used by the grounding system
2. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL log source URLs and grounding chunks for result verification
3. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL provide search entry point information for user transparency
4. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL implement proper error logging with SDK-specific error details
5. THE Ruby_GEM_Estimator SHALL maintain performance metrics for search grounding operations
