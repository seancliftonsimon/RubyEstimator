  - [x] 4.2 Add comprehensive timing information


    - Calculate and display total processing time for each vehicle
    - Add timing for major operation phases (validation, search, storage)
    - Display API call duration in milliseconds for performance analysis
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

  - [x] 4.3 Integrate with existing progress indicators


    - Ensure new logging works alongside existing progress callbacks
