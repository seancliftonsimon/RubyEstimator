# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive logging and transparency to the vehicle search and resolution process, enabling developers to diagnose bottlenecks, monitor API performance, and understand the complete flow from search input to final results. The system will provide detailed console output with timestamps for all major operations, API calls, and data processing steps.

## Glossary

- **Vehicle_Resolution_System**: The complete system that processes vehicle queries and returns vehicle specifications
- **API_Call_Logger**: Component responsible for logging API request/response details and timing
- **Process_Logger**: Component that logs internal processing steps and timing
- **Gemini_API**: Google's Gemini AI service used for vehicle data resolution
- **Console_Output**: Real-time logging information displayed to the user during processing
- **Timestamp_Marker**: Time-based markers showing start/end times for operations
- **Bottleneck_Analysis**: Performance monitoring data to identify slow operations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see detailed logging of all API calls with timestamps, so that I can identify performance bottlenecks and debug issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Vehicle_Resolution_System makes an API call to Gemini_API, THE API_Call_Logger SHALL log the request details with start timestamp
2. WHEN the Gemini_API responds, THE API_Call_Logger SHALL log the response details with end timestamp and duration
3. THE API_Call_Logger SHALL display the raw request payload sent to Gemini_API
4. THE API_Call_Logger SHALL display the raw response received from Gemini_API before analysis
5. THE API_Call_Logger SHALL calculate and display the total API call duration in milliseconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see step-by-step process logging with timestamps, so that I can understand exactly what the system is doing at each stage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Vehicle_Resolution_System begins any major processing step, THE Process_Logger SHALL log the step name with start timestamp
2. WHEN the Vehicle_Resolution_System completes any major processing step, THE Process_Logger SHALL log completion with end timestamp and duration
3. THE Process_Logger SHALL log cache lookup operations with results
4. THE Process_Logger SHALL log database operations with timing information
5. THE Process_Logger SHALL log validation steps and their outcomes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see what specific instructions are sent to Gemini and what raw responses are received, so that I can verify the AI interaction is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Call_Logger SHALL display the complete prompt/instruction text sent to Gemini_API
2. THE API_Call_Logger SHALL display the raw JSON response from Gemini_API before parsing
3. THE API_Call_Logger SHALL log any API errors or exceptions with full error details
4. THE API_Call_Logger SHALL log retry attempts and their outcomes
5. THE API_Call_Logger SHALL distinguish between different types of API calls (validation, resolution, etc.)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive timing information for all operations, so that I can identify which parts of the process are causing delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Process_Logger SHALL log timestamps for vehicle validation operations
2. THE Process_Logger SHALL log timestamps for two-pass resolution attempts
3. THE Process_Logger SHALL log timestamps for single-call fallback operations
4. THE Process_Logger SHALL log timestamps for database storage operations
5. THE Process_Logger SHALL calculate and display total processing time for each vehicle

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear visual separation and formatting of log output, so that I can easily read and understand the logging information during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Console_Output SHALL use consistent formatting for different types of log messages
2. THE Console_Output SHALL include visual separators between different vehicles being processed
3. THE Console_Output SHALL use different prefixes or colors for different log levels
4. THE Console_Output SHALL maintain the existing progress indicators while adding detailed logging
5. THE Console_Output SHALL ensure log messages are clearly readable and not cluttered
