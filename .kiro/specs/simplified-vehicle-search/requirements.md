# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds visual progress feedback below the vehicle search input to inform users about what specifications are being searched and the progress being made. The goal is to provide transparency into the search process without significantly modifying the existing UI structure.

## Glossary

- **Vehicle Search System**: The application component that allows users to search for and verify vehicle specifications
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual representation showing the status of individual specification searches
- **Search Progress Area**: The visual area below the search input that displays real-time search progress
- **Specification Status**: The current state of a specification search (searching, found, partial, failed)
- **Search Transparency**: Providing visibility into what the system is actively searching for

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user initiating a vehicle search, I want to see what vehicle specifications are being searched in real-time, so that I understand what the system is actively looking for and the progress being made.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a search query, THE Vehicle Search System SHALL display a visual progress area below the search input field
2. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL show individual specification items (weight, engine material, catalytic converters, rims, etc.) being searched with real-time status updates
3. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL use visual indicators (üîç searching, ‚úÖ found, ‚ö†Ô∏è partial data, ‚ùå not found) to show the current status of each specification search
4. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL update each specification item status in real-time as data is located and processed
5. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL display specifications in a horizontal or compact list format to minimize vertical space usage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user waiting for search results, I want to see clear progress indicators, so that I know the system is working and understand how much longer the search might take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL show a progress completion indicator (e.g., "3 of 5 specifications found")
2. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL display the current search phase (e.g., "Searching specifications...", "Resolving conflicts...", "Saving to database...")
3. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL provide visual feedback that the search is active and not stalled
4. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL show an estimated or relative completion status
5. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL clear the progress area once the search is complete and results are displayed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the existing vehicle search interface, I want the new progress information to integrate seamlessly, so that my current workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL add the progress area below the existing search input without modifying other UI elements
2. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL maintain all existing functionality and display patterns for search results
3. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL ensure the progress area does not interfere with existing result displays or interactions
4. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL use consistent styling that matches the existing interface design
5. THE Vehicle Search System SHALL hide the progress area when no search is active to avoid visual clutter
