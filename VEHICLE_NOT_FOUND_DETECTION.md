# üöó Vehicle Not Found Detection

## New Feature: Smart Error Messages

The system now intelligently distinguishes between two scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Vehicle Doesn't Exist ‚ùå

**Detection Logic:**

- Curb weight: Not found
- Aluminum engine: Not found
- Aluminum rims: Not found
- Catalytic converters: Not found
- **Result**: 0 out of 3 critical fields found

**Example:**

- 2001 Dodge Charger (Charger wasn't made from 1988-2005)
- 2025 Toyota Camry (future model not yet released)
- 2020 Ford Musting (typo - should be "Mustang")

**Message Shown:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Vehicle Not Found: Unable to find a 2001 Dodge Charger in our search results.

Please verify:
‚Ä¢ Year is correct (this make/model may not have been produced in 2001)
‚Ä¢ Make and model names are spelled correctly
‚Ä¢ This vehicle actually exists (not a concept car or unreleased model)

üí° Suggestions:
- Check if this model was produced in a different year range
- Try searching for a similar year (e.g., try years +/- 2 years)
- Verify the spelling of the make and model
- If you're certain this vehicle exists, use Manual Entry below
```

**Visual Style:**

- Red background (#fee2e2)
- Red left border (#dc2626)
- Warning icon ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Bold vehicle identification
- Clear action items

---

### Scenario 2: Vehicle Exists, But Missing Curb Weight ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Detection Logic:**

- Curb weight: Not found
- At least 1 other field found (aluminum_engine, aluminum_rims, or catalytic_converters)
- **Result**: 1-3 out of 3 critical fields found

**Example:**

- 2015 Honda Civic (exists, but specific trim's weight might be hard to find)
- 2020 Tesla Model 3 (exists, might have engine/rim data but weight varies by battery)

**Message Shown:**

```
Curb Weight Not Found: The search completed but could not find reliable curb weight data for this vehicle.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Found partial data:
‚úì Aluminum Engine: true
‚úì Aluminum Rims: true
‚úì Cat Converters: 2

üí° What to do next:
- Try a different model year (curb weight data may be available for nearby years)
- Use the Manual Entry option below if you know the vehicle's curb weight
```

**Visual Style:**

- Yellow/orange background (warning)
- Shows partial data found
- Suggests alternative years

---

## Detection Algorithm

```python
# Count how many critical fields were found
critical_fields_found = sum([
    vehicle_data.get('aluminum_engine') is not None,
    vehicle_data.get('aluminum_rims') is not None,
    vehicle_data.get('catalytic_converters') is not None
])

# Determine scenario
if critical_fields_found == 0:
    # Vehicle likely doesn't exist - show "Vehicle Not Found" message
    vehicle_likely_doesnt_exist = True
else:
    # Vehicle exists but missing curb weight - show "Curb Weight Not Found" message
    vehicle_likely_doesnt_exist = False
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Better User Experience**

- Clear feedback when they've made a typo
- Explicit guidance to check the year
- Reduces confusion about why no data was found

### 2. **Faster Problem Resolution**

- User immediately knows to check spelling/year
- Prevents wasted time trying different searches
- Suggests specific actions to take

### 3. **Reduces Support Questions**

- Self-explanatory error messages
- Built-in troubleshooting suggestions
- Clear next steps

## Real-World Examples

### ‚úÖ Correct Usage

```
2020 Honda Civic ‚Üí Found (all data)
2019 Ford F-150 ‚Üí Found (all data)
2018 Tesla Model S ‚Üí Found (might miss curb weight, but finds other fields)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Vehicle Exists, Missing Weight

```
2015 Honda Fit ‚Üí Finds engine/rims/cats, but not weight
2017 Subaru Crosstrek ‚Üí Finds most data except curb weight
```

### ‚ùå Vehicle Doesn't Exist

```
2001 Dodge Charger ‚Üí Not made in 2001 (discontinued 1987-2005)
2025 Toyota Corolla ‚Üí Future model not yet released
2020 Honda Civit ‚Üí Typo in model name
2015 Forddddd Focus ‚Üí Typo in make name
1890 Ford Model T ‚Üí Year too early
```

## Testing Recommendations

Test these scenarios to see the different messages:

1. **Non-existent vehicle:**

   - Year: 2001
   - Make: Dodge
   - Model: Charger
   - Expected: "Vehicle Not Found" message (red)

2. **Typo in model:**

   - Year: 2020
   - Make: Toyota
   - Model: Camrry (extra 'r')
   - Expected: "Vehicle Not Found" message (red)

3. **Obscure vehicle (might have partial data):**

   - Year: 2015
   - Make: Smart
   - Model: ForTwo
   - Expected: Might find some data or "Vehicle Not Found"

4. **Normal vehicle:**
   - Year: 2020
   - Make: Honda
   - Model: Civic
   - Expected: Full data found (no warnings)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- **Fuzzy matching**: Suggest similar vehicle names if typo detected
- **Year range validation**: Check against known production years
- **Make validation**: Verify make name against known manufacturers
- **Model suggestions**: "Did you mean 'Civic' instead of 'Civit'?"
