### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

Your repository is already ready! The API key is secured and the code is set up properly.

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

   - Choose your `RubyEstimator` repository
   - Click "Deploy"

4. **Automatic Configuration**:
   - Railway will use the `nixpacks.toml` file to configure the deployment
   - No manual configuration needed - the start command is already specified
   - The app will deploy automatically

### Step 3: Add Your API Key

1. **In your Railway project**, go to the "Variables" tab
2. **Add Environment Variable**:
   - **Name**: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `AIzaSyDhOpIAllne17hVDZI2ADXuUcSeE0cPYvY`
3. **Save** - your app will automatically redeploy

### Step 4: Access Your App

- Your app will be available at: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- The URL is private and not discoverable
- Only people you share the URL with can access it

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### App Won't Deploy

- Check that `requirements.txt` is in the root directory
- Verify the start command is correct
- Check Railway logs for errors

### "No start command could be found" Error

If you see this error, it means the deployment configuration files are missing:

- Ensure `nixpacks.toml` is in your repository root
- Verify `railway.json` is present
- Check that `runtime.txt` specifies a valid Python version
- Make sure all files are committed and pushed to GitHub

### API Key Not Working

- Double-check the environment variable name: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Ensure the key is valid and has sufficient quota
- Check Railway logs for API errors

### Database Issues

- Railway will create a new database on each deployment
- Consider using Railway's PostgreSQL for production
